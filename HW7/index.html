<h2>Pandemic! (Iteration)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The originality of my game is how I use the Corona Virus Pandemic as the feature of my game. I have not seen a game similar to this yet. The player simply infects others to dominate the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Controls:</strong>
Use the W,A,S,D keys for moving the player. Use the mouse to point a sneeze, and click on the mouse to expend a sneeze. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about my game technology is that I got the non-infected enimies to follow the player sprite and also bounce randomly throughout the game. I also added code so that in level 2 the eneimes will not only follow around the player, but will also shoot at the player. This added a good amount of complexity to my game that I have not done before. I am really proud of this game iteration with respect to the enmiemes shooting at my player. It took me a while to get the code all right to work flawlessly. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned alot from this prototype. I learned how to add health or hp to sprites. I also learned how to give my player health so that when a sprite shoots him, he can die and it is not just this endless loop. Another thing I thought I learned from this prototype was just how I can create one function that will control multiple sprites. In previous games, I copy and pasted code for specific sprite actions. Learning how to use the classes and features alike, I was able to shorten up my code a great deal than what it has been in past games.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I editied from a previous example with my own code. All borrowed items are listed below:
<ul>
<li> Some code borrowed from: <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">Phaser examples</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>

<li>Adaption from: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/topdownshooter/topdowncombatmechanics">Phaser examples</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Infect all non-infected players.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the Corona Virus as a theme for my game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used a lot of randomness, direct input, and first person shooter for my game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic this prototype evaluating is the kinesthetics of the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to experience excitement that they are allowed to infect other people during this pandemic. (Opposite of what they should do currently). I also want my players to experience virtual death. This is new to all of my games where you couldnt really die in prior prototypes.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The actions that my players can perform are sneezing on other people to infect them with the corona virus. I hope in iteration 3 to make it that other players can infect others, or also heal them to make the game harder.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A player strategy I would expect to see is shooting as fast as you can. I also see people moving about the screen as fast as they can. I also see that players can potentially hide from other shooters in the game so that they can expend their sneezes without hurting the main player.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?


The world my game is set in is in a pre-apoctoliptic world. This world is before the corona virus has taken over and made everyone sick. This is an anti-style game because you are the one infecting others with the virus because the player thinks that he can dominate the world. Overall, currently, the game is designed to infect as many people as you can to achieve world domination.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience I am trying to reach is pretty much anyone that wants to have fun. The audience is of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
My play time is meant to be played in about a minute. Its a quick, fast, fun, game.
