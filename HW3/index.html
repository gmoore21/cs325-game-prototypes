<h2>CatchACat</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The originality of my game is how I utilize a dog that can kill the player AND the cats you are trying to catch! This makes it harder to get a perfect score of 10.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about my game technology is that I got the two images to interact with another (the Cats and the Dog). I also messed around with the Random Generator function to drop in the cats at random places on the map.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned alot from this prototype. I learned how to create editied sprites, images, and audio files. One of the hardest things for me though was to get my syntax right. Although some of it was adapted from a previous model, I am still learning phaser at this point.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I editied multiple previous examples. They are listed below:
	- Audio: - Richard Wagner: Ride of the Valkyries (https://www.musikery.com/mp3/167c062d13d3d699c5db57879f5c6c6e55c1a75d6cd599771cf8ed06dd516e97.mp3)

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Catch as many cats as you can without dying.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the "A person with lots of cats" storymatic theme for this project as required by class.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used a lot of randomness, direct input, collector varieties for my game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic this prototype evaluating is the kinesthetics of the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to experience exitment that they have to try to catch something that can also die from a dog.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The actions that my players can perform are running and making sure that an extrapolated path of travel by a bad dog is not in the players current path while catching loose cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A player strategy I would expect to see is "hiding" from the dog with the structures within the game. Another stategy I could see from players would be that they would simply camp out in a structure and wait for the dog to pass rather than continuing to run around.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?


The world my game is set in is a house. I think its interesting because the premise of the game is to catch as many loose cats as possible before either the player dies, or the cats die. This game can be fun because it is really challenging to get all 10 cats. This game is meant to be a "perfectionists" game who likes a challenge because this game is hard.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience I am trying to reach is pretty much anyone that wants to have fun. The audience is of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
My play time is meant to be played in about a minute. Its a quick, fast, fun, game.
